# The Awesome manifest

As our favorite carrot once said "we want to make Fridays great again! :carrot:"

* Fridays are for doing awesome things!
* We value Do-ocracy higher than democracy in our achievement of awesomeness
* To get time for awesomeness, all meetings on Fridays should be concluded no later than 11:00 local time
* Awesomeness is not done alone, but with peers in a group setting (physical or virtual)
* Awesomeness must have a goal
* One cannot do awesomeness part time
* Awesomeness should be bragged about

All that wants to sign the awesome manifest will commit their name to the github repository.
